# WooCommerce S3 Export Pro - Quick Installation Guide

## üéØ Problem Solved

The "Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error" issue was caused by missing AWS SDK dependencies. This has been fixed by:

1. **Adding proper dependency management** with `composer.json`
2. **Creating an installation script** to automate dependency installation
3. **Making AWS SDK optional** so the plugin can activate even without S3 functionality
4. **Professional rebranding** for better user experience

## üöÄ Installation Steps

### 1. Upload the Plugin
Copy the plugin to your WordPress plugins directory:
```bash
cp -r woocommerce-s3-export-pro /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (REQUIRED)
Navigate to the plugin directory and run:
```bash
cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-s3-export-pro/
./install-dependencies.sh
```

**OR** manually with Composer:
```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### 3. Activate the Plugin
- Go to WordPress Admin ‚Üí Plugins
- Find "WooCommerce S3 Export Pro" and click "Activate"

### 4. Configure S3 (Optional)
If you want S3 upload functionality:
```bash
wp wc-s3 setup_s3_config YOUR_ACCESS_KEY YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```
